# Each person will have the following duties:

The purpose of this database is to take a movie and be able to look at awards it has won along with other metrics like box office figures and reviews.

# The Data:
Our dataset contains information for the movies beginning from 1927, but for our purposes we decided to cut the data to only the most recent 50 years.

# Instructions:
At some point we will type more about telling people how to recreate our steps.
